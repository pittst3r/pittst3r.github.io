# The .gov TLD

> Before we start, please recall the distinction between the Web and the Internet.

> The Internet is the physical network of servers and devices throughout the world allowing arbitrary data to be transmitted between us.
>
> The Web—short for World Wide Web—is a poignantly transient, rapidly deteriorating graph of interlinked HTML webpages, accessible using HTTP URLs, and largely served from Amazon servers, all of which utilizes the Internet for transport. Organizations frequently make their apps available through Web browsers with varying degrees of participation in the Web.

The `.gov` TLD being controlled by the US government[^cisa] is arguably enough of a reason to ditch the Web. Change my mind.
