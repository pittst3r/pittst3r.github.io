<h2>Eristic awareness</h2>
<p><em>by Robbie Pitts, 2021-07-13</em></p>
<p>It's common to offer our own perspectives before fully appreciating someone else's. Sometimes this is a conversational device to relate with others and elicit additional conversation, but when this behavior moves beyond this dialectical purpose it can lead to undesirable outcomes.</p>
<p>Eristic argument—characterized by antagonism and a desire to win the argument<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#eristic-argument">1</a></sup>—is far too common in organizational settings, yet it yields negative results and feelings.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#workplace-meeting-dialogue">2</a></sup> Those subjected to it will notice, and they will not like it. The antagonist may feel good about themselves, but others can intuitively observe that this dominative behavior will come at the expense of all other parties—including the larger organization.</p>
<p>Other people have valuable perspectives that have never crossed our minds, and if we are being intellectually honest, these perspectives can often change our own and respecting them can lead to improved outcomes. In fact, collective intelligence is improved with increased social sensitivity and mutual respect, unaffected by individual intelligence, and decreased when a subset of people in a group dominate the conversation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#collective-intelligence">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We would be better served, both personally and organizationally, by awareness of eristic argument in ourselves and others. Think about when you have been on the receiving end of this behavior, the outcome, and then consider when you've done it yourself. With this awareness, we will be better equipped to participate in constructive dialogue and achieve more desirable outcomes.</p>
