<h2>Eager Ego</h2>
<p><em>by Robbie Pitts, 2021-07-13</em></p>
<p>It is easy and common to offer our own perspectives before fully appreciating someone others'. This is annoying in a personal setting, but can additionally lead to undesirable business outcomes in an organizational setting.</p>
<p>And this is not limited to offering a conflicting perspective. It is also common to repeat someone’s perspective if we share a similar one, or to offer one’s own addendum. This creates the same problem, and is perhaps even more annoying.</p>
<p>Why are we eagerly trying to get our bit in? And what are we missing by doing this?</p>
<p>Other people have valuable perspectives that have never crossed our minds, and if we are being intellectually honest, these perspectives can often change our own and respecting them can lead to improved outcomes. In fact, collective intelligence is improved with increased social sensitivity and mutual respect, unaffected by individual intelligence, and decreased when a subset of people in a group dominate the conversation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The alternative is to seek to understand others’ ideas more thoroughly, from a place of respect and humility. We should be looking for new information that may improve our own understanding, and in the process, we will often find a third path that is better than what any individual could have come up with.</p>
<p>Next time you feel the urge to say your bit, try asking questions instead.</p>
